# Text Summarizer  

This repository features a Jupyter Notebook, **`Text_summarizer.ipynb`**, which demonstrates how to summarize large texts using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It is a beginner-friendly project for exploring text summarization using Python.

## Features  
- **Extractive Summarization**: Identifies and extracts the most important sentences from the input text.  
- **Preprocessing Steps**: Handles text cleaning, tokenization, and formatting for summarization.  
- **Interactive Workflow**: Easily test the summarization pipeline with custom input text.  
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust summary length and other parameters to fit your needs.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - NLTK  
  - Gensim  
  - SpaCy  
  - Hugging Face Transformers (if applicable)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for running code and visualizing outputs.  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python (version 3.7 or higher)  
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab  
- Required Python libraries (see below).  

### Installation  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShahilB/Text_Summarizer.git
   cd Text_Summarizer
   ```  

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Text_summarizer.ipynb
   ```  

## Usage  

1. Open the notebook `Text_summarizer.ipynb`.  
2. Follow the instructions in the cells to input your text.  
3. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess, summarize, and visualize the results.  
4. Experiment with different parameters to adjust the summary output.

## Example Output  
Input Text:  
> *"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and humans using natural language."*  

Summarized Text:  
> *"NLP is a subfield of AI that focuses on human-computer interaction using natural language."*  

## Future Enhancements  
- Add support for abstractive summarization.  
- Integrate summarization for files (PDF, Word).  
- Provide a web-based interface for non-technical users.
